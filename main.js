// Writing expressions with variables


//EXERCISE 1
//In your JavaScript file create a variable called myName with your name as the value. Put your name inside string quotes, e.g., "my name". 
//Then add a line of code to print the variable name to the console after the previous message.
//Save your JavaScript file in your editor. Reload the HTML page in your browser. You should see your name printed. If not, investigate and fix it.

const myName = "Maria";
console.log(myName);


//EXERCISE 2
//Create a variable called age with a number that is your age. Do not use string quotes for numbers.
//Add a line to print that variable in the console. Save the file and reload the page. You should see your name and your age.
